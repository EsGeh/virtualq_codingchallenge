# virtualq\_codingchallenge

## Introduction

This is a coding exercise to simulate a queuing situation in a call center.
For a more detailed explanation, see [here](ProgrammingTask-Ruby.pdf).
The challenge originally was devised to be solved in Ruby.
This is my attempt to solve it in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) instead.
It was a nice exercise in functional software design.
